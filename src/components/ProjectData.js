            SHELTER is board game adapted for mobile! In this game, you receive a random set of cards that
            determine your gender, age, profession, and other traits, and your task is to convince the others
            that this set of characteristics will be very useful for survival in the bunker.
            </p>
            <p>
            SHELTER, my first venture into iOS app development, served as a comprehensive exercise in 
            leveraging the React Native framework, coupled with the extensive capabilities of the Expo
            ecosystem. This project marked my entry into the world of mobile app development and was a
            gaming experience custom-made for my friends.
